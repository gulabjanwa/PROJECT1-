                <h2>Missile Man of India</h2>
                <p> <b>The Indian National Congress (INC)</b>, colloquially the Congress Party or simply the Congress,
                    is a
                    political party in India with deep roots in most regions of India. Founded on 28 December 1885, it
                    was the first modern nationalist movement to emerge in the British Empire in Asia and Africa.[a][29]
                    From the late 19th century, and especially after 1920, under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi, the
                    Congress became the principal leader of the Indian independence movement.[30] The Congress led India
                    to independence from the United Kingdom,[b][31][c][32] and significantly influenced other
                    anti-colonial nationalist movements in the British Empire.[d][29]</p>
